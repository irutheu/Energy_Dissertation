Dissertation plan:
march 21

0) Preparations
- Find good graphical editor for diagrams and figures
- Talk to advisor and get some literature to quote on
- Cooperate with fellow students
- Skim through other people thesises to get some clues about proper structure
- Find similar papers or works to get deeper understanding of the field

1) Intro: Current problems in energy generation and consumption complex. 
- Point out poor prediction process. Power stations are loaded based on old formulas. This can be solved with energy output prediction with sufficient amount of data.
- Point out new ways of predicting amount of energy that will be consumed by end consumers such as households, factories etc.
- Explain basis of uniting energy producers and energy consumers into single, solid system.
- Also include Renewable energy sources (Hydro, wind, solar and so on) and accumulation of power by various means.
- Current problems and hardships in development of new energy systems:
1) Most likely very expensive
2) Requires whole new technology level over internet and old physical interfaces
3) If this systems will be implemented, problem of infosec will be at whole new level, since all information will be carried over the internet.
4) something else I missed

2) Related works and current systems of energy production forecast:
- Russian "Energynet"
- Internet of Energy
- Energy transition (especially in Germany and Switzerland)
- I've seen some already, there must some information in previous papers i've published.
- Ask my adviser for some materials or recommendations for further study.

3) Ways to implement desired system
- Python or any other programming language
- Neural nets, regressions, decision trees, arimas and so on

4) The system itself
- Graphical illustration of the system with relations between parts
- How the system works
- Comparison between default uncoordinated system and implemented coordinated system
- Table which contains comparison of results

5) Useful literature and links
