Theme: Energy system optimization for isolated electrical systems with renewable energy sources.
Synopsis: Energy consumptions is a time-series data which is forecasted by machine learning. We have traditional reliable energy sources with stable output such as fuel generators or bio generators. We also have unreliable energy sources such as solar and wind, output of those sources is also a time series which is forecasted by machine learning. In the end we have a system with reliable and unreliable generation for supplying energy consumption.

0) Preparations
- Find good graphical editor for diagrams and figures
- Talk to advisor and get some literature to quote on
- Cooperate with fellow students
- Skim through other people thesises to get some clues about proper structure
- Find similar papers or works to get deeper understanding of the field

1) Intro: Current problems in energy generation and consumption complex. 
- Point out poor prediction process. Power stations are loaded based on old formulas. This can be solved with energy output prediction with sufficient amount of data.
- Point out new ways of predicting amount of energy that will be consumed by end consumers such as households, factories etc.
- Explain basis of uniting energy producers and energy consumers into single, solid system.
- Also include Renewable energy sources (Hydro, wind, solar and so on) and accumulation of power by various means.
- Current problems and hardships in development of new energy systems:
1) Most likely very expensive
2) Requires whole new technology level over internet and old physical interfaces
3) If this systems will be implemented, problem of infosec will be at whole new level, since all information will be carried over the internet.
4) something else I missed

2) Related works and current systems of energy production forecast:
- Russian "Energynet"
- Internet of Energy Technology
- Energy transition movement? (especially in Germany and Switzerland)
- Microgrids (siemens)
- Modeling tools for microgrids - DER-CAM, EnergyPLAN (both from wiki on microgrids)
- I've seen some already, there must some information in previous papers i've published.
- Ask my adviser for some materials or recommendations for further study.

3) Equipment and knowledge necessary for implementing
- Power meters installed at consumer buildings
- DLMS/COSEM - open protocol for two-way data transmission in energy networks
- Microgrid control from wiki
- Energy generation from solar and wind is a time series
- Energy consumption is also a time series
- Python or any other programming language
- Neural nets, regressions, decision trees, arimas and so on

4) The system itself
- Graphical illustration of the system with relations between parts
- How the system works
- Comparison between default uncoordinated system and implemented coordinated system
- Table which contains comparison of results

5) Useful literature and links
